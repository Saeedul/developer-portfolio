            <p>You might've seen me staring at my laptop with with no sense of the world around. If you did, I was
                probably binge watching on netflix or trying to wrap my head around about my future. So yeah, I don't
                wanna
                write more here. Just feel free to roam around and see how this works.</p>

            <h2>Become a web developer</h2>
            <p>Having learned the HTML and CSS, I am able to build any simple website. I can even teach my grandma on
                how to make simple websites like this. My goal is to learn and implement code and research as I progress
                through my career.</p>
