            <p>You might've seen me staring at my laptop with with no sense of the world around. If you did, I was
                probably binge watching on netflix or trying to wrap my head around about my future. So yeah, I don't
                wanna
                write more here. Just feel free to roam around and see how this works.</p>

            <h2>Become a web developer</h2>
            <p>Having learned basic HTML and CSS, I am able to build any simple website. I'm still in the first learning
                stages of my web development. So you'll see more upcoming projects going live in the future. My goal is
                to learn and implement code and research as I progress
                through my career.</p>

                <p>I can do HTML, CSS and Javascript very well. I am aware of everything needed to make a website
                    function,
                    efficient. I didn't just stop there. I went beyond with one of the most popular Javascript
                    frameworks,
                    Vue.js. I even know about the tactics of deployment, server management and security assurance.</p>

                <p>I was on my way to learning new things and then I found the world of web development. A place where I
                    could express my creativity. So, I kept learning and here I am.</p>
